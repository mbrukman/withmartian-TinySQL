generated_data_columns:
  - name: column_names
    generation_prompt: >-
      Generate a list of 1 to 6 realistic SQL column names for the table '{table_name}'.
      Each column name should be in snake_case, relevant to the table's content, and should not include any additional text or formatting.
      Examples:
        - For "users": "user_id", "username", "email", "created_at", "last_login", "is_active"
        - For "orders": "order_id", "customer_id", "total_amount", "order_date", "status", "shipping_address"
        - For "employees": "salary", "age", "department_id", "hire_date", "job_title", "is_manager"
        - For "products": "product_name", "price", "stock_quantity", "category_id", "created_at", "is_active"
      Do not include any additional text or formatting.
      Ensure these column names will be used exactly as generated.

    columns_to_list_in_prompt: [table_name]

  - name: selected_columns
    generation_prompt: >-
      From the list of column names '{column_names}', randomly select 1 to 3 columns 
      to include in the SQL query.

    columns_to_list_in_prompt: [column_names]

  - name: column_data_types
    generation_prompt: >-
      Suggest appropriate SQL numeric data types (e.g., INT, FLOAT, DECIMAL) for each column 
      in '{column_names}'. Provide a list matching each column to its data type. 
      For non-numeric columns (like names or descriptions), you may use VARCHAR(255).
      Do not include any additional text or formatting.

    columns_to_list_in_prompt: [column_names]

  - name: sql_prompt
    generation_prompt: >-
      Generate a natural language instruction for a SQL query to select '{selected_columns}' from '{table_name}'.
      The instruction should begin with the phrase '{instruction_phrase}' and should NOT use the exact snake_case column names or table name.
      Instead, use natural language variations, synonyms, or descriptive phrases. 
      For example:
        - If the table_name is "employees" and selected columns are "age" and "salary", 
          you might say: "What do the staff members earn and how old are they?" 
          rather than "What is the age and salary from employees?"

      Important Guidelines:
        * Do not use the exact snake_case names directly in the prompt. For instance, if the column is "salary", you might refer to it as "what they earn" or "their compensation".
        * Do not use the exact table name "employees" directly, instead say something like "our staff roster", "the team records", or "the personnel list".
        * The instruction should remain clear, but it's allowed to be more indirect or human-readable.
        * Do not include any additional formatting beyond the instruction itself.

  - name: sql_context
    generation_prompt: >-
      Generate the SQL CREATE TABLE statement for a table named '{table_name}' that includes the columns '{column_names}' 
      with data types '{column_data_types}'. The statement should be executable, syntactically correct, 
      and should not include any additional text or formatting.

      Important Guidelines:
        * Include all columns from '{column_names}'.
        * Use the given '{table_name}' exactly.
        * Assign each column the corresponding data type from '{column_data_types}'.
        * Do not include any additional text, comments, or formatting outside of the statement.

    columns_to_list_in_prompt: [table_name, column_names, column_data_types]
    llm_type: code

  - name: sql
    generation_prompt: >-
      Write the SQL query that selects '{selected_columns}' from '{table_name}' as per the idea described in '{sql_prompt}'.

      Important Guidelines:
        * Although the prompt used natural language variations, the actual SQL must use the exact snake_case names '{table_name}' and '{selected_columns}'.
        * The query should select exactly the chosen columns.
        * Do not include any additional text or formatting outside of the query itself.
        * The query should semantically respond to the prompt's request, but does not need to match it literally, as this is a "Not Exact Match" scenario.
