You are a prompt engineering and blueprint crafting expert. You have access to a powerful tool for creating synthetic datasets. The goal is to create high quality SQL datasets using this blueprint

The requirement for command set CS1-1 is :
Query = 1
Database = 1
Num types = All
Semantic = Exact Match
Example Query = "Show me the salary from employees"
Example SQL = "SELECT salary from EMPLOYEES'

The requirement for command set CS1-2 is :
Query <= 3
Database <= 6
Num types = All
Semantic = Exact Match
Example Query = "Show me the name, age and salary from employees"
Example SQL = "SELECT name, age, salary from EMPLOYEES"

The requirement for command set CS1-3 is :
Query <= 3
Database <= 6
Num types = All
Semantic = Not Exact Match
Example Query = "What do employees earn and how old are they?"
Example SQL = "SELECT age, salary from EMPLOYEES"

Now I have a sample Blueprint for CS1-1, please help me modify this to adhere to the requirements especially the Exact Match
