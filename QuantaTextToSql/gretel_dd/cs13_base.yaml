generated_data_columns:
  - name: column_names
    generation_prompt: >-
      Generate {{num_columns}} realistic SQL column names for the table '{table_name}'.
      Ensure the chosen column name can be used as is in the SQL query, and that it differs clearly from '{table_name}'.

      Important Guidelines:
        * The column name must be in snake_case like "total_amount" or "created_at".
        * It should be relevant to the type of entities in '{table_name}'.
        * Avoid overly similar or derived forms of the table name. Choose distinct attributes.
        * Use a common, domain-specific attribute unrelated directly to the table_name. For instance:
          - For "users": "email", "created_at", "last_login", "status", "age"
          - For "orders": "order_date", "total_amount", "customer_id", "status"
          - For "employees": "salary", "age", "department_id", "hire_date", "job_title"
        * If asked for multiple columns, ensure they are distinct and seperate by commas.
        * Do not include any additional text or formatting.

    columns_to_list_in_prompt: [table_name]

  - name: selected_columns
    generation_prompt: >-
      From the column names '{column_names}', randomly select {{num_selected_columns}} column{{plural}} to include in the SQL query.
      Include just the selected column names (separated by commas if multiple).

      Important Guidelines:
        * Do not add or remove characters; use the columns exactly as provided.
        * Do not include any additional text or formatting.
        * Do not include 'selected columns' in the response.

    columns_to_list_in_prompt: [column_names]

  - name: column_data_types
    generation_prompt: >-
      Suggest appropriate SQL numeric data types (e.g., INT, FLOAT, DECIMAL, VARCHAR(255)) for {{num_columns}} in '{column_names}' in the table '{table_name}'. 
      Do not include any additional text or formatting. Do not include any column names, just the {{num_columns}} data types (separated by commas if multiple).

    columns_to_list_in_prompt: [column_names]

  - name: sql_prompt
    generation_prompt: >-
      Generate a clear and concise natural language instruction for a SQL query to select '{selected_columns}' from '{table_name}'. 
      The instruction should begin with the phrase '{instruction_phrase}' and should NOT use the exact snake_case column names or table name.
      Instead, use natural language variations, synonyms, or descriptive phrases.
      For example:
        - If the table_name is "employees" and selected columns are "age" and "salary", 
          you might say: "What do the staff members earn and how old are they?" 
          rather than "What is the age and salary from employees?"
        - For a table_name "commodity_prices", you might say "commodity prices", "Commodity Prices", "commodityPrices", "CommodityPrices", or "commodity_prices".
        - For a column_name "commodity_id", you might say "commodity id", "commodityId", "Commodity ID", "commodity_id".

      Important Guidelines:
        * The instruction should remain clear, but it's allowed to be more indirect or human-readable.
        * When referring to the table and column in this instruction, you may use natural language variations.
        * The goal is to present the table and column in a variety of human-readable or commonly used naming styles, not strictly following snake_case.
        * Do not include any additional text or formatting beyond the instruction itself.

    columns_to_list_in_prompt: [instruction_phrase, selected_columns, table_name]

  - name: sql_context
    generation_prompt: >-
      Generate the SQL CREATE TABLE statement for a table named '{table_name}' that includes the columns '{column_names}' 
      with data types '{column_data_types}'. The statement should be executable, syntactically correct, 
      and should not include any additional text or formatting.

      Important Guidelines:
        * Use the provided '{table_name}' and '{column_names}' exactly.
        * Include all columns from '{column_names}'.
        * Match each column to the corresponding data type from '{column_data_types}'.
        * Do not include any additional text or formatting other than the SQL statement itself.

    columns_to_list_in_prompt: [table_name, column_names, column_data_types]
    llm_type: code

  - name: sql
    generation_prompt: >-
      Write the SQL query that selects '{selected_columns}' from '{table_name}' as per the instruction '{sql_prompt}'.

      Important Guidelines:
        * The SQL query must use the exact snake_case names '{table_name}' and each of '{selected_columns}'.
        * The query should select columns as indicated by '{selected_columns}'.
        * Do not include any additional text or formatting.
        * The query must match the instruction's intent and names exactly.
